Estrella is a 3D star map engine which facilitates generation and visualization of star maps from the perspective of exoplanets with a 360 view. This star map engine addresses the Exosky! challenge by providing a highly realistic star map containing exoplanet data from the NASA exoplanet archive and star data from the ESA Gaia DR3 dataset. Approximately 470 million stars were calculated against each if 5731 exoplanets totaling ~2600 billion calculations. This was possible due to highly optimized CPU and GPU code. This star map is realistic enough to give experienced viewers insight into the skies of exoplanets while also being visually appealing and fun for kids and teens to explore the stars in the planet's sky.
